# Web-API-Code-Quiz

## Description

In this project, students were given the task to build a code quiz from scratch. To successfully complete this task students needed to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website that dynamically changes. It features a timer, multiple choice questions and highscores.  

Starting this project was fairly moderate, as HTML and CSS are  simple when building a static website. But, when it came to JavaScript, it became difficult. I used help from Forums in the internet, chatGPT, and from Learning assistants. It was fun building an application that used JavaScript and seeing how it can interact with the user was inspiring.
